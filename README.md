# odin-recipes

My Odin Recipe Website is a simple, user-friendly platform. It showcases a collection of my favorite Indian recipes, each with clear instructions, ingredient lists, and images. This static website serves as a personal cookbook, making it easy to share delicious homemade recipes with family and friends."

This will be my First ever website on The Odin Project and Completing this website will make sure I have completely understood the HTML Foundation section of The Odin Project and I'm able to make a basic recipe website with it.
